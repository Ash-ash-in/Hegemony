# **HEGEMONY**
---

## Description
This a personal project, with the loose aim of finding new ways to play and test strategies for the board game *hegemony*.
The vision is to have three working modules:
- The game - all the rules, objects, and systems that enable someone to play the game.
- The actors - an interface for a human to play the game, and a rule-set to allow the 'automata' to play
- The brain - a machine learning model that is able to play the game, hopefully with some skill. Different models may be build for different play-styles.
The game should serve as the 'core' of the program, with different actors, be them humans, AI, or a rule-set, attached to different factions for the game.
The project serves primarily as an educational and entertainment tool for myself, so it should stay fun for me. I don't want it to get overwhelming, and I want to keep it manageable. That means taking things one step at a time, doing proof-of concept before diving in to the final product, and acheiving managable goals that can pass test or add new features. I reserve the right to make braindead decisions and do things like a fucking moron.

## Development Notes
### Last Session:
- Some planning and organising
- Files sort of talk to each other but not very well, they seem to break depending on where I call them from.

### To-Do:
- Saving is not working but I feel like it's close. Need to test running directly in document and in main file
- Figure out how the files talk to each other, and set this up across each file
- Continue setting up the core parts of the game - set up a process for branching decisions for a really simple process, and slowly scale up from there
